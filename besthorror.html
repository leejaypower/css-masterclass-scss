          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.
        </h3>
        <p>
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            <h2>Mute Witness (1995)</h2>
            <h3>Directed by Anthony Waller</h3>

          <p>
            The first 34 minutes of Mute Witness are some of the most
            suspenseful I’ve experienced in any film, and the first 5 minutes
            some of the funniest. It features an inspired 15-minute
            cat-and-mouse chase through a labyrinthian film studio after Billy,
            a mute make-up artist, stumbles upon a snuff film being shot in the
            studio after hours. The chase features several perfectly timed near
            misses that must have been incredibly difficult to nail.

            An interesting tidbit: Anthony Waller, the director, had a moment of
            serendipity when he bumped into Sir Alec Guinness a full three years
            before filming on Mute Witness began. He took a chance and asked if
            Alec would be willing to shoot a cameo for his next film. To his
            surprise, Guinness said he’d be delighted and that he would do it
            for free. Guinness was booked for the next eighteen months, so
            Waller suggested they shoot the scene the following morning in an
            underground car park. Guinness readily agreed and, true to his word,
            took no payment.
          </p>
          <p>It would be Sir Alec Guinness’s final film.</p>
